The Reading Exchange is an app the connects book lovers to one another and allows them to exchange books from their personal collection. While the world gets more technological every day people still prefer to have a physical book versus a download a book to a tablet or an audiobook. As of 2016 research shows that 73% of Americans have read a book in the past 12 months. Of those 74% of Americans, 65% have read a printed book, more than double the share of e-book (28%) and more than four times the audio books (14%).

The e-book and audio book source are not replacing people's desire for books. But with today's busy world and desire for instant gratification we are using technology with our app to connect people quickly and get books in their hands. Users can post books from their personal connection that they will lend out to other users. Users can post reviews on books they have read. Users can search thorugh the database of books available and if they find one they want it will send the owner of that book a message with the information needed to ship that book out to the other user. It's kinda like a virtual Library at your finger tips.
